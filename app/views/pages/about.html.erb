            I’ve been designing with computers since the day I first opened Microsoft Paint. The cusp of art and technology has always fascinated me and I've never been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's Paint, Photoshop, Sketch or CSS.

Fast forward to 2019 and I’ve tried it all, from Digital Campaign Design and Flash Actionscript to Web Design, Animation and HTML/CSS, to Product Design and Product Management. Everything I have done, small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today: A Senior Product Manager at GoDaddy.

What excites me most about being part of the Product sector in the tech industry is being able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real problems. Leaning into customer research and insight, finding the right problems to solve, delivering that value as quickly as possible, learning from it and then iterating and improving that value over time is the key to great design
